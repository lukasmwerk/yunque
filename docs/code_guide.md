### Doc Comments

Doc comments use tags in parentheses to indicate important meta-information about symbols. For example if a function or implementation is intended to be a temporary placeholder and will likely be replaced with some other implementation in the future, it would be tagged (immediately following the symbol name) something like (PLACEHOLDER). Other tags include (DEPRECATED) (UNTESTED) (NOT WORKING) (EXPERIMENTAL) (INSECURE). This allows users of most modern editors to see if there are known issues or caviats to a symbol. Usually most tags can be assigned to the struct or interface of "objects" for example to indicate that a part of the objects functionality may not be tested (UNTESTED) as this may have unintended consequences on other parts of the objects state. If you use an object, you acknowledge that the object might not be 100% reliable.
